# Papyro Documentation

[简体中文](zh-CN/README.md) | [Repository README](../README.md)

This directory is intentionally small. Older phase notes, duplicated design drafts, and one-off investigation documents were consolidated into the guides below so new contributors can find the current truth quickly.

If you are unsure where a change belongs:

- UI layout or controls: `crates/ui`
- User flow, state mutation, side effects: `crates/app`
- Pure models or rules: `crates/core`
- SQLite, filesystem, workspace scan, watcher: `crates/storage`
- Platform dialogs and shell integration: `crates/platform`
- Markdown summary, render, protocol structs: `crates/editor`
- Tiptap runtime behavior: `js/src/tiptap-runtime.js`, `js/src/tiptap-*.js`, `js/src/tiptap-react/`, `js/src/editor-host-runtime.js`, or shared helpers in `js/src/editor-runtime-bootstrap.js`
- Theme tokens or Markdown visual language: `assets/main.css`, `apps/*/assets/main.css`, and [theme-system.md](theme-system.md)

## Documentation Maintenance Rules

- Keep README visitor-friendly. Do not turn it into an internal design dump.
- Keep architecture current with code. If a module moves, update [architecture.md](architecture.md).
- Keep roadmap product-facing and actionable. Avoid historical diary entries.
- Keep performance trace names in both [performance-budget.md](performance-budget.md) and [roadmap.md](roadmap.md). CI checks this.
- Keep Chinese docs aligned with the English docs when changing contributor-facing behavior.
