# Papyro Development Standards

[简体中文](zh-CN/development-standards.md) | [Documentation](README.md)

These rules keep Papyro easy to change, review, and recover. They apply to humans and AI coding agents.

## Working Principles

- Read [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) before starting roadmap work.
- Keep one task to one minimal behavioral goal.
- Prefer existing module boundaries and helper APIs.
- Avoid unrelated refactors, formatting churn, dependency changes, and generated file drift.
- Keep `git status` explainable before every commit.
- Never revert work you did not make unless explicitly asked.

## Architecture Boundaries


| Area              | Owns                                                                 | Must not own                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `apps/*`          | platform shell, launch config, assets                                | shared business flow          |
| `crates/app`      | runtime, dispatcher, handlers, effects, workspace flows              | low-level persistence details |
| `crates/core`     | models, state structs, traits, pure rules                            | Dioxus, filesystem, SQLite    |
| `crates/ui`       | Dioxus components, layouts, view models, i18n                        | direct file writes            |
| `crates/storage`  | SQLite, files, workspace scan, watcher                               | UI behavior                   |
| `crates/platform` | dialogs, app data, reveal, external links                            | app state mutation            |
| `crates/editor`   | Markdown summary, render, protocol                                   | storage writes                |
| `js/`             | Tiptap runtime behavior, editor facade, Markdown interaction helpers | Rust state truth              |


When dependency direction changes, run:

```bash
node scripts/check-workspace-deps.js
```

## Dioxus 0.7 Rules

- Use `#[component] fn Name(...) -> Element`.
- Use `Signal<T>`, `ReadOnlySignal<T>`, `use_signal`, `use_memo`, and `use_resource`.
- Props must be owned values and implement `PartialEq + Clone`.
- Use `document::Stylesheet`, `document::Script`, and `asset!` for resources.
- Do not use removed APIs: `cx`, `Scope`, or `use_state`.

## Rust Rules

- Run `cargo fmt --check`.
- Keep clippy warning-free.
- Preserve error context with `anyhow`, `thiserror`, or explicit messages.
- Never hide save, watcher, or filesystem failures.
- Never mark a dirty tab clean after a failed write.
- Avoid blocking IO and large clones in Dioxus render paths.
- Add tests for pure rules, state transitions, storage flows, and bug fixes.

## Editor JS Rules

Only edit focused source files under `js/src/` by hand. The most common entry
points are:

- `js/src/editor-entry.ts`
- `js/src/editor-runtime.ts`
- `js/src/editor-runtime-contract.ts`
- `js/src/tiptap-*.js`
- `js/src/tiptap-react/`
- `js/src/editor-host-runtime.ts`
- `js/src/editor-runtime-bootstrap.ts`

Then run:

```bash
node scripts/check-editor-markdown-gate.js
```

Every commit that touches Tiptap, editor runtime, editor CSS, generated editor
bundles, Markdown parsing, Markdown rendering, Preview parity, or node views must
prove that Markdown files still render. Do not commit if any Markdown smoke
check fails. `check-tiptap-runtime-smoke.js` mounts a real Tiptap editor and
must keep rendering the Markdown fixture without runtime errors.
The dedicated editor gate runs JS tests, rebuilds the editor bundle, checks
Markdown styling, verifies Markdown round-trip behavior, mounts the real Tiptap
runtime, and confirms desktop/mobile `editor.js` and editor runtime style copies
are synchronized.

Generated files must be committed with the source change:

- `assets/editor.js`
- `apps/desktop/assets/editor.js`
- `apps/mobile/assets/editor.js`
- `apps/desktop/assets/styles/markdown.css`
- `apps/desktop/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome.css`
- `apps/desktop/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-code.css`
- `apps/desktop/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-base.css`
- `apps/desktop/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-command.css`
- `apps/desktop/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-table.css`
- `apps/desktop/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-block.css`
- `apps/desktop/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-papyro.css`
- `apps/mobile/assets/styles/markdown.css`
- `apps/mobile/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome.css`
- `apps/mobile/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-code.css`
- `apps/mobile/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-base.css`
- `apps/mobile/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-command.css`
- `apps/mobile/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-table.css`
- `apps/mobile/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-block.css`
- `apps/mobile/assets/styles/tiptap-chrome-papyro.css`

## Documentation Rules

- README is for visitors and quick start.
- [architecture.md](architecture.md) is the current code map.
- [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) is the current product and engineering priority.
- [tiptap-refactor-plan.md](tiptap-refactor-plan.md) is the editor refactoring contract.
- [performance-budget.md](performance-budget.md) must mention every trace checked by `scripts/check-perf-docs.js`.
- Keep Chinese docs aligned when contributor-facing behavior changes.
- Finishing a task includes updating existing documentation that the task changes. Do not leave roadmap, architecture, editor, performance, README, or skills documents describing the old behavior.
- Architecture-affecting roadmap work must update [architecture.md](architecture.md) in the same task or explicitly explain why no architecture document change is needed.
- Editor behavior changes must update [tiptap-refactor-plan.md](tiptap-refactor-plan.md) when protocol, Hybrid behavior, Preview behavior, Markdown rendering, or JS/Rust responsibilities change.
- Performance-sensitive changes must update [performance-budget.md](performance-budget.md) when trace names, budgets, large-document policy, or render-path ownership changes.
- Broad UI redesign work should run `node scripts/report-ui-tokens.js` and update [ui-token-audit.md](ui-token-audit.md) when token debt changes materially.
- AI workflow changes must update [ai-skills.md](ai-skills.md) and the relevant `skills/*/SKILL.md` file.

## Validation

Use the full script before broad changes:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check.ps1
```

```bash
bash scripts/check.sh
```

The full suite includes:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo check --workspace --all-features
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
node scripts/check-workspace-deps.js
node scripts/report-file-lines.js
node scripts/report-file-lines.js --self-test
node scripts/check-ui-a11y.js
node scripts/check-ui-a11y.js --self-test
node scripts/check-ui-primitives.js
node scripts/check-ui-primitives.js --self-test
node scripts/check-ui-contrast.js
node scripts/check-ui-contrast.js --self-test
node scripts/report-ui-tokens.js
node scripts/report-ui-tokens.js --self-test
node scripts/generate-perf-fixtures.js --self-test
node scripts/check-tiptap-release-smoke.js
node scripts/check-tiptap-release-smoke.js --self-test
node scripts/check-tiptap-runtime-smoke.js
node scripts/check-tiptap-theme-bridge.js
node scripts/check-tiptap-theme-bridge.js --self-test
node scripts/check-editor-markdown-gate.js
node scripts/check-perf-smoke.js --self-test
node scripts/check-perf-docs.js
node scripts/check-perf-docs.js --self-test
npm --prefix js run build
npm --prefix js test
```

The script also verifies generated editor bundles stay synchronized.

## Commit Standards

- Use English Conventional Commits: `type: summary`.
- One commit should represent one minimal task.
- Keep the title readable, ideally under 50 characters and never over 72.
- `scope` is optional. Use it only when it improves search.
- Body is optional. Do not write a body when the title is enough.
- If a body is needed, keep it directly tied to the diff.
- Do not pad commit messages with roadmap slogans, tool logs, or generic praise.
- Do not mix unrelated formatting, dependency updates, generated files, and behavior changes.

Common types:


| Type       | Use                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | user-visible capability                      |
| `fix`      | bug fix or incorrect state correction        |
| `docs`     | documentation or explanatory comments        |
| `refactor` | structural change without behavior change    |
| `test`     | test additions or fixes                      |
| `perf`     | performance improvement                      |
| `build`    | build, dependency, packaging, generated flow |
| `ci`       | CI or automation                             |
| `style`    | CSS or formatting-only change                |
| `chore`    | maintenance                                  |


Good titles:

```text
docs: update architecture guide
fix: preserve dirty save state
feat: render hybrid headings
refactor: move autosave effects
test: cover save retry flow
```

Good body:

```text
fix: preserve dirty save state

Keep SaveStatus::Dirty when storage rejects a write so the tab still
prompts before close.
```

Bad titles:

```text
update code
fix things
wip
misc changes
feat: add everything
```

Bad body:

```text
- Improve many files and keep existing architecture boundaries.
- Update according to roadmap and run checks.
- Make the app cleaner, safer, and more professional.
```

## PR Checklist

- The change solves one clear problem.
- The module boundary is respected.
- Generated files are in sync.
- Relevant English and Chinese docs are updated.
- Tests or manual validation are listed.
- Data safety, performance, or rollback risk is called out when relevant.
- `git status` contains no accidental files.

## Safety Rules

- Do not commit secrets, tokens, local-only paths, or personal environment files.
- File write, delete, rename, export, and sync changes must prioritize user content safety.
- Delete flows need explicit UI entry and confirmation strategy.
- If data safety is uncertain, reduce risk before adding capability.
