# Tiptap Editor Refactoring Plan

[简体中文](zh-CN/tiptap-refactor-plan.md)

This document is the complete execution plan for refactoring Papyro's editor from its current messy custom implementation to a Notion-like editor based on official Tiptap UI Components.

## Goals

- Closely align with the official Tiptap Notion-like Editor template in experience and architecture
- Maximize use of official UI Components (Pro license available)
- Migrate to React + TypeScript stack
- Remove all redundant custom code, improve maintainability and readability
- Keep Markdown as the persisted source format

## Tech Stack Assessment

| Dimension | Current State | Target State |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Language | Mixed TypeScript with 44 tracked `.js` files and 4 tracked `.jsx` files still under `js/src/` as of 2026-05-13 | TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) |
| Build | esbuild (native TS support, no changes needed) | esbuild + tsconfig |
| UI Framework | React 18.3 (already satisfied) | React 18.3 (unchanged) |
| Tiptap | 3.23.1 (already aligned) | 3.23.1+ (keep same version) |
| Component Source | Many custom DOM controllers + partial React | Official UI Components source + minimal adapters |
| Styling | Custom SCSS scattered everywhere | Official component styles + unified design tokens |

Conclusion: React is already satisfied, TypeScript can be incrementally migrated (esbuild native support), no blockers.

## Current Expert Audit (2026-05-13)

The editor has moved in the right direction, but it is not yet at the official Notion-like template quality bar.

- Table architecture: `PapyroOfficialTableNodeLayer` now mounts the official `TableHandle`, `TableSelectionOverlay`, `TableCellHandleMenu`, and `TableExtendRowColumnButtons` outside `EditorContent`, matching the official table-node integration contract. The remaining issue is host chrome drift: Papyro-specific CSS currently strengthens the official handles and scopes table menu content in a way that can make handles look heavy and nested dropdowns feel inconsistent.
- Table UX target: keep the official table-node SCSS as the component owner, and limit Papyro CSS to host layout, viewport safety, theme token bridging, and Markdown persistence constraints. Row/column handles should feel like subtle Notion-like affordances, not persistent developer toolbar controls.
- JavaScript inventory: `js/src/` still contains 44 tracked `.js` files and 4 tracked `.jsx` files. They are source files, not generated output. They fall into three buckets: core runtime/registry/Markdown sync modules that must become TypeScript, Papyro-specific Markdown/media adapters that should be typed after behavior coverage, and legacy React support files that should either migrate to TSX or be deleted once the official component path fully owns the UX.
- Formatting entry points: the top shell toolbar must stay app-level only. Rich-text formatting belongs to official Tiptap React surfaces: `PapyroToolbarFloating`, slash menu, drag context menu, link popover, and table-node menus. The active `PapyroToolbarFloating` still diverges from the official Notion-like toolbar by keeping text alignment, undo/redo, and highlight controls permanently visible; it should become an official-template composition with only Papyro-specific omissions such as AI/Cloud controls.
- Verification bar: for every UI convergence step, run source tests, build, and the editor Markdown gate; for visual changes, prefer desktop WebView/manual smoke or a screenshot-backed check when the app target is available.

## Architecture Alignment: Official Notion-like Template Structure

Post-refactoring directory structure should align with the official CLI installation layout:

## Phases

### Phase 0: Generate Baseline Template via Official CLI

Official recommended path: use the Tiptap CLI to install the complete Notion-like Editor template, obtain the official standard source code, then trim unneeded parts and adapt to Papyro's architecture.

> The CLI targets Vite/Next.js projects. Papyro uses custom esbuild, so the strategy is:
> Use the CLI to generate a complete Vite reference project under `.reference/` as the authoritative source baseline.

#### 0.1 Generate Official Template Reference Project
- [x] Login to Tiptap Pro account: `npx @tiptap/cli@latest login`
- [x] Initialize complete template under `.reference/`:
  ```bash
  cd .reference
  npx @tiptap/cli@latest init notion-like-editor --framework vite
  ```
- [x] Add generated project directory to `.gitignore`
- [x] Review generated file structure, confirm all components, extensions, hooks, and styles are present

#### 0.2 TypeScript Base Configuration
- [x] Add `typescript`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom` to `js/package.json` devDependencies
- [x] Create `js/tsconfig.json` with `allowJs: true`, path alias `@` → `src/`
- [x] Update `js/build.js` entry to `.ts` extension, add `.ts`/`.tsx` loader mappings
- [x] Verify esbuild can bundle mixed JS/TS files correctly

#### 0.3 Restructure Directories per Official Template
- [x] Create corresponding directories under `js/src/` matching the generated template structure
- [x] Copy official template component source (TSX) directly into the project
- [x] Trim unneeded components (AI, collaboration, Emoji, Mention related)
- [x] Keep existing `tiptap-node/table-node/` (already aligned with official)
- [x] Import necessary global styles and CSS variables per official style configuration

---

### Phase 1: Integrate Official UI Components

Copy official component source from the CLI-generated template into the project, integrate and verify one by one. Each component gets its own commit.

#### 1.1 Style Infrastructure
- [x] Copy official style configuration from template (CSS variables, design tokens)
- [x] Establish Papyro's global style foundation per template's `styles/` directory
- [x] Ensure dark/light theme CSS variables are in place

#### 1.2 UI Primitives Layer
Copy the following primitive components from the template (they are dependencies of all higher-level components):
- [x] `button` + `button-group`
- [x] `dropdown-menu`
- [x] `popover`
- [x] `toolbar` (including `ToolbarGroup`, `ToolbarSeparator`)
- [x] `separator`
- [x] `spacer`
- [x] `tooltip`

#### 1.3 Hooks and Utility Libraries
- [x] `use-mobile`
- [x] `use-window-size`
- [x] `use-ui-editor-state`
- [x] `tiptap-utils` (trim AI/collaboration utility functions)

#### 1.4 Slash Command Menu (Highest Priority)
- [x] Copy official `slash-dropdown-menu` component
- [x] Copy dependent `suggestion-menu` utility component

- [x] Connect to Rust-side `run_slash_command` protocol
- [x] Verify `/` trigger, search filtering, keyboard navigation work correctly

#### 1.5 Drag Handle + Block Action Menu
- [x] Copy official `drag-context-menu` component
- [x] Copy dependent `floating-element` utility component
- [x] Configure context menu items: transform block type, color/highlight, copy/delete, reset formatting
- [x] Ensure `withSlashCommandTrigger` links with 1.4's slash menu
- [x] Verify drag reordering serializes correctly to Markdown

#### 1.6 Floating Format Toolbar (Bubble Menu)
- [x] Use official `<Tiptap.BubbleMenu>` as container
- [x] Copy and integrate the following official toolbar components:
  - `mark-button` (bold, italic, underline, strike, code)
  - `heading-dropdown-menu`
  - `list-dropdown-menu`
  - `color-highlight-popover`
  - `text-align-button`
  - `link-popover`

#### 1.9 Extension Layer
- [x] Copy official `selection-extension`
- [x] Copy official `trailing-node-extension`
- [x] Copy official `mathematics-extension` (connect to existing KaTeX)
- [x] Copy official `unique-id-extension`

---

### Phase 2: Remove Old Custom Code

After Phase 1's official components are confirmed working, progressively remove corresponding old implementations:

#### 2.1 Remove Old DOM Controllers
The current `tiptap-runtime.js` creates many controllers via dependency injection, now replaced by official React components:

- [x] Remove `block-handle-controller` (replaced by: official `drag-context-menu`)
- [x] Remove `block-action-menu-controller` (replaced by: built into official `drag-context-menu`)
- [x] Remove `format-toolbar-controller` (replaced by: official `BubbleMenu` + toolbar components)
- [x] Remove `slash-menu-controller` (replaced by: official `slash-dropdown-menu`)
- [x] Remove `link-editor-controller` (replaced by: official `link-popover`)
- [x] Remove `table-toolbar-controller` (replaced by: official `table-node` built-in menus)

#### 2.2 Remove Custom React Views (Replaced by Official Components)
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/slash-menu-view.jsx`
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/block-action-menu-view.jsx`
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/block-handle-view.jsx`
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/format-toolbar-view.jsx`
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/link-editor-view.jsx`
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/components/block-action-menu.jsx`
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/components/block-handle.jsx`
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/components/format-toolbar.jsx`
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/components/link-editor.jsx`
- [x] Remove `tiptap-react/commands/block-action-menu-model.js` (functionality merged into drag-context-menu)

#### 2.3 Remove Custom Style Files
- [x] Audit all `.scss` files, remove styles that duplicate official components
- [x] Keep only Papyro-specific styles (Mermaid, KaTeX, etc.)

#### 2.4 Remove Outdated Documentation
- [x] Remove `docs/tiptap-enterprise-editor-todo.md` (replaced by this document)
- [x] Remove `docs/zh-CN/tiptap-enterprise-editor-todo.md`
- [x] Review other docs files, remove content that no longer applies

---

### Phase 3: Core Runtime Refactoring

#### 3.1 Simplify editor-runtime
- [x] Rewrite `tiptap-runtime.js` as `editor-runtime.ts`
- [x] Remove all controller factory injection, let React components manage their own state
- [x] Keep core responsibilities: Editor instance creation, Rust protocol bridge, Markdown sync
- [x] Runtime only does: create Editor → mount React tree → forward Rust commands/events

#### 3.2 Simplify editor-entry
- [x] Rewrite `editor-tiptap-entry.js` as `editor-entry.ts`
- [x] Remove all view factory registrations (DI injection of React views no longer needed)
- [x] Entry only does: create runtime → install on `window.papyroEditor`

#### 3.3 React Island Refactoring
- [x] Keep `island.jsx` → migrate to `island.tsx`
- [x] Keep slot architecture (BeforeContent / EditorContent / AfterContent / OverlayLayer)
- [x] Keep `runtime-context` → migrate to TS, simplify interface
- [x] Keep `mount-controller` → migrate to TS
- [x] Remove unused slot definitions from `slots.tsx`

---

### Phase 4: Table Component Completion

The table-node is partially integrated, needs completion:

- [x] Confirm all official table-node interactions are correctly mounted:
  - Row/column handles (show on hover)
  - Cell selection overlay
  - Row/column extend buttons
  - Context menu (insert/delete rows/columns, merge/split cells)
  - Column width resize
- [x] Remove redundant bridging logic in `tiptap-table-command-controller.js`
- [x] Remove code in `tiptap-table.js` replaced by official components
- [x] Ensure table Markdown serialization is correct (GFM table format)
- [x] 2026-05-13 follow-up: remove legacy Papyro table chrome from `markdown.css` and `tiptap-chrome-base.css`; keep table host styling in `tiptap-chrome-table.css` so official handle/menu SCSS owns the component look
- [x] 2026-05-13 follow-up: migrate `tiptap-react/official-table-node-layer.jsx` to `official-table-node-layer.tsx`
- [x] 2026-05-13 follow-up: scope table dropdown sizing, z-index, and menu-item rhythm to the official table-node menus via `tiptap-table-menu-content`, avoiding global overrides of slash/link/drag menus
- [x] 2026-05-13 audit follow-up: soften Papyro's table host overrides so official table-node handles, extend rails, and cell action dots match the Notion-like reference more closely
- [x] 2026-05-13 audit follow-up: keep nested table menus (`ColorMenu`, `TableAlignMenu`) on the scoped table menu surface without changing slash/link/drag menu styling
- [x] 2026-05-13 audit follow-up: remove Papyro-specific handle, extend button, and cell-dot visual overrides so the official table-node SCSS owns the Notion-like table chrome

---

### Phase 5: Incremental TypeScript Migration

Migrate by module priority, one module at a time:

#### 5.1 Core Modules (Priority)
- [x] `tiptap-runtime.js` → `editor-runtime.ts`
- [x] `editor-runtime.js` → `editor-runtime-contract.ts`
- [x] `editor-tiptap-entry.js` → `editor-entry.ts`
- [x] `tiptap-react/runtime-context.jsx` → `.tsx`
- [x] `tiptap-react/runtime-model.js` → `.ts`
- [x] `tiptap-react/island.jsx` → `.tsx`
- [x] `tiptap-react/mount-controller.jsx` → `.tsx`

#### 5.2 Component Modules
- [x] All components under `tiptap-ui/` (official source is already TSX)
- [x] All primitives under `tiptap-ui-primitive/`
- [x] All node components under `tiptap-node/`
- [x] All hooks under `hooks/`

#### 5.3 Utilities and Tests
- [x] Utility functions under `lib/`
- [x] Test file migration (keep `node --test` runner)

#### 5.4 Current TypeScript Debt Audit (2026-05-13)
- [x] Audit the remaining tracked JS/JSX inventory: 44 `.js` files and 4 `.jsx` files under `js/src/`
- [ ] Migrate the remaining 44 `.js` files and 4 `.jsx` files under `js/src/` to `.ts`/`.tsx`, or delete them when an official TS/TSX component already owns the behavior
- [ ] Split the remaining JS/JSX migration into three tracks: core runtime (`editor-*`, `markdown-sync-controller`), Papyro feature adapters (`tiptap-math`, `tiptap-mermaid`, `tiptap-image`, `tiptap-callout`, etc.), and leftover React support (`tiptap-react/*`, `tiptap-react-island.jsx`)
- [x] Convert `tiptap-table-command-controller.js` to `tiptap-table-command-controller.ts` after table command behavior was covered by source and runtime tests
- [x] Convert `tiptap-table.js` to `tiptap-table.ts` after table command behavior was covered by source and runtime tests
- [x] Convert `tiptap-table-commands.js` to `tiptap-table-commands.ts` so table command metadata and menu models expose typed boundaries
- [ ] Convert `editor-core.js`, `markdown-sync-controller.js`, `editor-host-runtime.js`, `editor-registry.js`, `editor-runtime-bootstrap.js`, and `editor-runtime-selector.js`
- [ ] Convert remaining React support files under `js/src/tiptap-react/`, including code-block node view, primitive wrappers, hooks, and utility modules
- [ ] Add a passing `npm --prefix js run typecheck` gate once current TS template debt is typed or intentionally isolated
- [ ] Resolve known typecheck blockers before enabling the gate: missing official image extension dependency/types, `allowImportingTsExtensions` import paths, implicit `any` in table-handle utilities, and typed runtime context boundaries

---

### Phase 6: Style Unification

- [x] Establish unified design tokens (CSS variables) aligned with official component style system
- [x] Remove all custom SCSS that duplicates official components
- [x] Keep Papyro-specific styles: Mermaid diagrams, KaTeX math formulas, source mode
- [x] Ensure dark/light theme switches via CSS variables (official components already support this)
- [x] Audit `table-node.scss`, `table-handle-menu.scss` etc.; keep upstream official SCSS and move Papyro-only table host overrides into `tiptap-chrome-table.css`

---

### Phase 7: Papyro-Specific Feature Adaptation

These features are unique to Papyro, not in the official template, and need to be preserved and adapted to the new architecture:

- [x] Markdown source mode (Source/Hybrid/Preview tri-mode switching)
- [x] Rust protocol bridge (`window.papyroEditor` facade)
- [x] Local image paste (file saving handled by Rust side)
- [x] Mermaid diagram rendering
- [x] KaTeX math formula rendering
- [x] Outline/TOC generation (consumed by Rust side)
- [x] i18n multilingual support
- [x] Multi-tab editor instance management (editorRegistry)

---

### Phase 8: Testing and Verification

- [x] Update `tiptap-runtime-smoke.js` for new architecture
- [x] Update all existing test files for new module paths
- [x] Add Markdown serialization round-trip tests for each official component
- [x] Verify `scripts/check-editor-markdown-gate.js` passes
- [x] End-to-end verification of all interactions in desktop WebView

---

### Phase 9: Editor Chrome and UX Convergence

The editor surface must behave like the official Notion-like template first, with Papyro shell controls kept outside the rich-text formatting workflow.

- [x] Remove the legacy Rust/Dioxus Markdown insertion toolbar from the top chrome
- [x] Keep app-level controls in the titlebar: tabs, sidebar toggle, theme switch, settings, window controls, and outline toggle
- [x] Use official Tiptap floating toolbar, slash menu, drag context menu, and table menus as the formatting entry points
- [x] Remove or quarantine old `mn-tiptap-format-toolbar`, legacy block handle, and legacy block action menu CSS after confirming no mounted React component still depends on it
- [x] Compare `PapyroToolbarFloating` against the official Notion-like toolbar composition and remove any remaining Papyro-only command model that duplicates official toolbar components
- [x] Replace the active floating toolbar composition with the official Notion-like pattern: turn-into, marks, image floating controls, link/text color, and a More popover for superscript/subscript, alignment, and indentation; exclude AI/Improve until a real local/Pro-backed AI workflow is implemented
- [ ] Audit remaining top-level editor layout against the official Notion-like template after each migrated component
- [ ] Add visual regression coverage for table handles, cell menu, floating toolbar, slash menu, and drag handle once the desktop WebView smoke can run in CI

## Excluded Components (Explicitly Not Integrating)

| Component | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `ai-menu` / `ai-ask-button` | Requires online AI service, not applicable for local editor |
| `improve-dropdown` | AI feature, same as above |
| `emoji-dropdown-menu` | Not needed for local Markdown editor |
| `mention-dropdown-menu` | Requires user system, not applicable for local editor |
| `collaboration` / `collab-context` | Requires Tiptap Cloud, not applicable for local editor |
| `image-node-pro` | To be evaluated later, basic `image-node` may suffice |

---

## Execution Principles

1. **CLI-first**: Use the template generated by `npx @tiptap/cli@latest init notion-like-editor` as the authoritative reference source. All component implementations follow official generated code, no inventing.
2. **Direct copy + trim**: Copy official TSX source from the generated template directly into the project, only make necessary adaptations (remove AI/collaboration dependencies, connect Papyro Rust protocol, local image handling).
3. **One commit per official component**, containing: source import, adaptation changes, old code removal, test verification.
4. **Build before delete**: Integrate official components and confirm they work before deleting corresponding old custom implementations, avoiding functionality gaps.
5. **Markdown serialization first**: For each component integrated, verify its content survives Markdown round-trip without loss.
6. **Incremental TS migration**: Official components are already TSX, keep as-is; old code converts gradually during refactoring.
7. **No online dependencies**: Exclude all components requiring Tiptap Cloud / AI services.

## Estimated Effort

| Phase | Estimate | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Phase 0 | 1-2 days | CLI template generation + TS config + directory restructure |
| Phase 1 | 5-7 days | Copy official components from template and adapt (largest effort) |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 days | Remove old custom code (verify each removal doesn't break functionality) |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 days | Runtime refactoring |
| Phase 4 | 1-2 days | Table completion |
| Phase 5 | 3-4 days | TS migration of remaining files |
| Phase 6 | 1-2 days | Style unification |
| Phase 7 | 2-3 days | Papyro-specific feature adaptation |
| Phase 8 | 1-2 days | Testing and verification |

Total approximately **18-28 working days**.
