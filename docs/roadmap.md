# Papyro Roadmap

[简体中文](zh-CN/roadmap.md) | [Documentation](README.md)

Papyro's roadmap is intentionally focused. The product should become a professional local-first Markdown workspace before it becomes a large feature platform.

## Product North Star

Papyro should feel like a calm desktop writing tool:

- local Markdown files stay user-owned and portable
- Hybrid mode feels close to Typora for everyday writing
- Source and Preview remain available for advanced control
- workspace, tabs, search, outline, trash, assets, and recovery feel predictable
- startup, tab switching, file operations, and editing stay responsive on real projects
- the architecture remains understandable for new contributors

## Quality Bar

```mermaid

  root((Professional Papyro))
    Reliable data
      dirty state survives failed writes
      recovery drafts are explainable
      delete moves through trash
    Fast interactions
      measured trace names
      bounded render paths
      no accidental editor rebuilds
    Mature UI
      quiet layout
      clear hierarchy
      no noisy controls
    Maintainable code
      thin app shells
      app-owned flows
      pure core rules
      tested storage
```

## Current Architecture Facts

- `apps/desktop` and `apps/mobile` are thin shells.
- `crates/app` owns runtime, dispatcher, handlers, effects, and workspace flows.
- `crates/core` owns models, state, traits, and pure rules.
- `crates/ui` owns Dioxus components, layouts, view models, and i18n.
- `crates/storage` owns SQLite, filesystem, workspace scanning, watcher, metadata, and recovery.
- `crates/platform` owns system integration.
- `crates/editor` owns Markdown summary, rendering, block analysis, and protocol structs.
- `js/` owns the CodeMirror runtime and generated editor bundle.

See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the current map.

## Phase 1 - Foundation And Data Safety

Goal: make workspace, tab, settings, save, and recovery flows reliable.

- [x] Move shared runtime orchestration into `crates/app`.
- [x] Keep platform shells thin.
- [x] Split workspace flows into use-case modules.
- [x] Preserve dirty state on failed saves.
- [x] Add recovery draft flows.
- [x] Add settings persistence queue.
- [x] Add workspace dependency checks.
- [x] Audit save/conflict paths for external file changes and OS-opened Markdown files.
- [x] Make file association open requests a first-class use case with tests.

## Phase 2 - Performance As A Contract

Goal: make common interactions measurable and hard to regress.

- [x] Add trace names for editor and chrome interactions.
- [x] Add performance smoke checker.
- [x] Add file line budget checks.
- [x] Add UI accessibility and contrast checks.
- [x] Keep generated editor bundles synchronized.
- [ ] Capture manual desktop traces before large editor or chrome changes.
- [x] Add automated smoke coverage for the highest-risk editor paths.

Tracked trace names:

- `perf app dispatch action`
- `perf editor pane render prep`
- `perf editor open markdown`
- `perf editor switch tab`
- `perf editor view mode change`
- `perf editor outline extract`
- `perf editor command set_view_mode`
- `perf editor command set_preferences`
- `perf editor input change`
- `perf editor preview render`
- `perf editor host lifecycle`
- `perf editor host destroy`
- `perf editor stale bridge cleanup`
- `perf chrome toggle sidebar`
- `perf chrome resize sidebar`
- `perf chrome toggle theme`
- `perf chrome open modal`
- `perf workspace search`
- `perf tab close trigger`
- `perf runtime close_tab handler`

## Phase 3 - Desktop Shell And Core UX

Goal: make the app look and behave like a professional note editor.

- [x] Redesign desktop shell layout.
- [x] Improve sidebar icons, menus, root selection, and empty-area context menu behavior.
- [x] Remove the native desktop menu bar.
- [x] Add i18n support for English and Chinese UI text.
- [x] Improve settings layout and dark-mode contrast.
- [x] Replace app shell branding assets.
- [x] Move Settings into an independent desktop window.
- [x] Keep settings window size stable across sections.
- [x] Replace native-looking `select`, modal, message, menu, and tooltip surfaces with Papyro design-system components.
- [x] Define component primitives for `Button`, `IconButton`, `Select`, `SegmentedControl`, `Modal/Dialog`, `Message/Toast`, `ContextMenu`, `Tooltip`, `Tabs`, and `FormField`.
- [x] Use proven open-source component systems as references, not direct React dependencies. [Radix Primitives](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives) is a strong behavior/accessibility reference, and [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) is a strong copy-and-own visual/component composition reference.
- [x] Finish mobile layout pass after desktop behavior stabilizes.

Settings-window direction:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    main["Main window<br/>writing and workspace"]
    settings["Settings window<br/>global preferences"]
    runtime["ProcessRuntime<br/>shared settings cache"]
    storage["Storage<br/>settings persistence"]

    main --> runtime
    settings --> runtime
    runtime --> storage
    storage --> runtime
```

The settings window should be a process-level tool window. It should update live settings without forcing the main editor window to remount.

## Phase 3.5 - UI/UX System Redesign

Goal: make Papyro look deliberately designed, not demo-like or AI-generated.

Reference direction:

- Benchmark top Markdown and knowledge products before redesigning: Feishu Docs, Yuque, Notion Docs, Obsidian, and other polished 2026-era enterprise tools.
- Study modern enterprise UI systems such as Linear and Fluent UI for density, hierarchy, keyboard-first flows, component states, and accessibility discipline.
- Keep Papyro's own identity: local-first Markdown, calm writing, fast workspace navigation, and professional desktop ergonomics.
- Use references as quality benchmarks, not direct proprietary copies. Extract principles for navigation, writing flow, component states, density, and accessibility.
- Produce a comparison matrix before implementation: workspace navigation, editor chrome, block insertion, Markdown rendering, outline, search, command palette, settings, empty/loading/error states, keyboard paths, themes, and narrow-window behavior.

Design work:

- [x] Audit every primary surface: desktop shell, sidebar, editor header, tab bar, outline, status bar, settings, search, quick open, command palette, trash, recovery, empty states, loading states, and error states. See [UI Surface Audit](ui-surface-audit.md).
- [x] Create a benchmark and gap-analysis document with source links, screenshots, interaction notes, and concrete Papyro redesign decisions before changing the main CSS. See [UI/UX Benchmark And Redesign Decisions](ui-ux-benchmark.md).
- [x] Define a new product visual brief: typography, spacing scale, color roles, surface elevation, border radius, icon style, density, motion, focus rings, and copy tone. See [Papyro UI Visual Brief](ui-visual-brief.md).
- [x] Redesign the app information architecture so workspace navigation, document editing, outline, commands, and settings feel cohesive instead of assembled screen by screen. See [UI Information Architecture](ui-information-architecture.md).
- [x] Inventory the Dioxus-first component system over CSS tokens and define the target primitives: `Button`, `IconButton`, `Input`, `Select`, `SegmentedControl`, `Switch`, `Dialog`, `Popover`, `DropdownMenu`, `ContextMenu`, `Tooltip`, `Toast/Message`, `Tabs`, `SidebarItem`, `TreeItem`, `Toolbar`, `EmptyState`, and `Skeleton`. See [UI Architecture And Component Inventory](ui-architecture.md).
- [x] Add a CSS token audit for raw colors, spacing one-offs, and duplicated component selectors before broad visual rewrites. See [UI Token Audit](ui-token-audit.md).
- [x] Replace native-looking controls and one-off product controls with reusable primitives for sidebar search, tree rows, inline rename, editor tabs, outline items, settings color inputs, and editor chrome controls.
- [x] Centralize primitive state class names through `PrimitiveState` and `ClassBuilder` for active, open, disabled, destructive, editing, drag, drop, expanded, onboarding, and resizing states.
- [x] Add first primitive interaction CSS variables for button, icon button, editor tool, and view-mode option hover, active, focus, disabled, and destructive states.
- [ ] Continue reducing one-off CSS by moving repeated hover, active, disabled, focus-visible, loading, destructive, compact, selected, and checked state rules into reusable primitive contracts.
- [x] Create layout primitives for app chrome: split panes, resizable rails, scroll containers, sticky toolbars, fixed editor action zones, and responsive overflow rules.
- [ ] Make Markdown writing surfaces visually match mature editors: quiet canvas, readable measure, balanced margins, polished code/table/callout styles, and consistent Preview/Hybrid typography.
- [x] Add design QA artifacts: component inventory, before/after screenshots, desktop narrow-width screenshots, dark-mode screenshots, contrast checks, keyboard navigation checks, and CSS line-budget checks. See [UI Design QA Checklist](ui-design-qa.md).
- [x] Document the new UI architecture so future contributors know where to add components, where tokens live, and when one-off CSS is forbidden.

Acceptance bar:

- Papyro should feel closer to a serious desktop knowledge tool than a prototype.
- Screens must not rely on generic gradients, noisy cards, random colors, or decorative filler.
- Components must be reusable, accessible, keyboard-friendly, and visually coherent in light and dark themes.
- Layout must remain stable when the window narrows, tabs overflow, long filenames appear, or dialogs switch sections.

## Phase 4 - Markdown Editing Experience

Goal: make Hybrid mode useful for real writing, not just decorated source text.

- [x] Add Rust block analysis for headings, lists, tables, code, math, and Mermaid.
- [x] Add Preview rendering with code highlighting and Mermaid support.
- [x] Add Hybrid decorations and runtime block states.
- [x] Improve paste replacement and Markdown input commands.
- [x] Add Mermaid rendered/editing behavior.
- [ ] Make Hybrid selection, cursor hit testing, and inline decorations feel consistent.
- [x] Define pointer behavior precisely: hovering text should enter edit semantics, hovering line-gap whitespace should stay in normal semantics, gap selection should target the next line's text, text-area selection should target the current line, and selection backgrounds should cover glyph runs instead of full line-gap blocks.
- [x] Make code block, inline code, links, lists, and Mermaid editing share consistent selection colors.
- [ ] Treat cursor offset, wrong-line hit testing, missing selection background, accidental source reveal, and selection leaking into whitespace as architecture-level Hybrid defects, not isolated CSS bugs.
- [x] Review mainstream editor architecture patterns before continuing Hybrid patches: CodeMirror decorations/widgets, ProseMirror/Tiptap node views, Lexical decorators, Slate void/inline nodes, and Typora-like source/render switching. See [Hybrid Editor Architecture Review](editor-hybrid-architecture.md).
- [x] Decide a stable selection and hit-testing strategy for inline elements, code blocks, tables, math, Mermaid, and links before adding more Markdown block features.
- [x] Add regression coverage or repeatable smoke scripts for cursor placement, text selection, IME composition, paste replacement, and block edit/render transitions.
- [x] Align Hybrid editing with modern Markdown writing tools such as Typora and Feishu Docs: inserting tables, math, code blocks, callouts, links, images, and Mermaid should be discoverable and fast.
- [x] Add editor insertion affordances for common blocks instead of requiring users to remember Markdown syntax for every task.
- [x] Make table creation and editing feel document-native: add rows/columns, move between cells, preserve alignment, and avoid layout jumps.
- [x] Make math insertion and editing first-class, including inline math, display math, preview feedback, and error states.
- [ ] Treat enterprise-grade editing as the bar: predictable paste, undo, selection, IME, keyboard navigation, accessibility, and stable layout are required before calling Hybrid complete.
- [x] Decide whether long-term Hybrid remains CodeMirror decoration-based or moves toward a richer document model.

See [editor.md](editor.md).

## Phase 4.1 - Tiptap Editor Runtime Migration

Goal: use the `feat-tiptap` branch to migrate the interactive editor runtime from CodeMirror to Tiptap/ProseMirror while preserving Markdown files, the Rust/Dioxus protocol, and enterprise-grade maintainability.

See [Tiptap Migration Plan](tiptap-migration-plan.md).

Engineering bar:

- New code must be reusable, iterative, resilient, and clearly modular.
- Do not replace the current large runtime with another giant `editor.js`.
- Every complex block needs a Markdown round-trip strategy and tests.
- Preserve the `window.papyroEditor` facade during migration so Rust/Dioxus stay independent from editor internals.
- Use the official Tiptap Notion-like editor template as an interaction benchmark for slash commands, floating toolbars, block insertion, and responsive editor chrome, while keeping Papyro local-first and Markdown-first.
- Generated bundles, desktop/mobile assets, CSS line budgets, a11y, contrast, primitive usage, and Rust/JS tests must keep passing.

Tasks:

- [x] Create the dedicated `feat-tiptap` migration branch.
- [x] Document the Tiptap migration architecture, risks, phases, and definition of done.
- [x] Commit and push the migration plan.
- [x] Extract the first runtime adapter facade contract and tests.
- [x] Add runtime registry and injectable CodeMirror runtime factory modules.
- [x] Split the JS editor runtime into a stable facade, registry, and adapter contract.
- [x] Switch the migration branch default runtime to Tiptap while keeping an explicit CodeMirror fallback.
- [x] Install and wire the Tiptap foundation dependencies.
- [x] Implement a Tiptap adapter prototype behind a feature flag or runtime selector.
- [x] Support basic Markdown round-trip: paragraphs, headings, lists, blockquotes, bold, italic, inline code, code blocks, and links.
- [x] Redefine Source/Hybrid/Preview: Hybrid uses Tiptap, Preview remains Rust-rendered, and Source remains Markdown-editable.
- [x] Add a Tiptap Source pane backed by `MarkdownSyncController`.
- [x] Make the Tiptap Source pane ignore unchanged input so it does not emit redundant dirty/content events.
- [x] Support outline navigation and active heading sync in Tiptap Source and Hybrid modes.
- [x] Add a reusable slash command controller as the headless foundation for Notion-like but Papyro-native block insertion.
- [x] Add the first Notion-like but Papyro-native slash command menu controller.
- [x] Add the first Papyro-native floating formatting toolbar controller.
- [x] Make floating format toolbar buttons pointer-first so inline formatting does not lose to WebView focus ordering.
- [x] Add the first Papyro-native block handle controller.
- [x] Upgrade the block handle into Notion-like dual controls: `+` opens block insertion, while the handle selects the current block and opens block actions.
- [x] Fix block handle event wiring so repeated hover updates keep the action/insert callbacks alive and the `+` insert entry opens from pointer interaction in WebView.
- [x] Keep the block handle hover bridge alive while moving from text to floating controls so the action and insert affordances do not disappear across the gutter gap.
- [x] Add the first Papyro-native block action menu controller.
- [x] Match the official Tiptap Notion-like template quality bar for block menus: copy as Markdown, duplicate block, and delete are now available from the block menu, with pointer-first menu activation to avoid WebView/ProseMirror focus races.
- [x] Wire the block action menu's advertised shortcuts so Ctrl/Cmd+C copies, Ctrl/Cmd+D duplicates, and Delete/Backspace removes the selected block while the menu is open.
- [x] Stabilize block handle menus so left-click opens actions on release, right-click does not leak the native WebView menu, small pointer jitter does not become an accidental drag, and moving from the handle into a floating menu keeps the menu open until an outside click.
- [x] Split the block handle state machine against the official Drag Context Menu benchmark: a normal click selects the current block and opens the current-block menu next to the pointer, drag starts only after the movement threshold, and right-click opens only the Papyro menu while blocking WebView native menus.
- [x] Keep an open block action or insert menu anchored to its original block while the pointer moves across nearby blocks, so menus do not drift or disappear during normal mouse movement.
- [x] Add a reset-formatting block action that clears marks, color, and highlights from the current block with localized English/Chinese labels.
- [x] Make the `+` insertion control create a dedicated slash paragraph on the next line and open the insertion menu at that caret position instead of behaving like a hidden block action.
- [x] Keep the block action menu focused on current-block actions and styles, with insertion owned by `+` and slash commands.
- [x] Clean up the temporary `/` paragraph created by the `+` insertion flow when the user cancels the menu, while preserving slash triggers the user typed manually.
- [x] Make the `+` insertion menu ignore suspicious window-origin caret coordinates from WebView/Tiptap mount races and fall back to the source block edge, so the menu does not appear in the top-left corner.
- [x] Keep block action and `+` insertion menus stable across editor blur, selection refreshes, and normal pointer movement inside the floating menu, so the menu only closes on an outside click, Escape, scroll, resize, or command execution.
- [x] Polish block action and slash/`+` insertion menus into enterprise-grade command panels with localized headers, tighter section rhythm, stronger selected-block feedback, and resilient tests that no longer depend on fragile child indexes.
- [x] Harden the shared floating dismiss lifecycle for slash, `+`, and block action panels with pointer, mouse, focus, scroll, and resize guards, so WebView focus races do not make command panels vanish while users move into them.
- [x] Split floating menu dismiss semantics by event type: outside pointer events still close immediately, while focus races that return to the editor host, temporary slash paragraph, or WebView body keep block action, `+`/slash insertion, and table command panels open until the user intentionally leaves.
- [x] Refine slash and block action panel density, radii, icon sizing, and list rhythm so the menus feel like deliberate document command panels instead of temporary debug lists.
- [x] Keep command panels open during editor-internal scroll and WebView scroll restoration races while preserving outside-scroll dismissal, so a tiny pointer move after opening a handle or `+` menu no longer collapses the panel.
- [x] Tighten slash/`+` and block-action panel visuals with a quieter command-panel shell, smaller icon wells, stable scrollbar gutters, and a restrained selected-item rail instead of generic button-list styling.
- [x] Treat the floating block handle itself as a safe boundary for block action and `+` insertion menus, so clicking or moving back through the handle does not dismiss the open command panel before the user can choose an action.
- [x] Keep `+` block insertion menus in insertion mode across Tiptap selection/update refreshes, preserving the temporary slash range, anchor, and cleanup semantics so normal WebView refreshes do not collapse or retarget the menu.
- [x] Make block-handle clicks open the action menu on pointer release like a document editor context handle, while preserving threshold-based drag sorting and retargeting open menus after ProseMirror remounts the block DOM.
- [x] Keep block-handle pointerdown as drag preparation only: the action menu no longer flashes open before a real drag decision, which prevents small pointer movement from closing the menu immediately after it appears.
- [x] Keep open block action and `+` insertion panels alive when ProseMirror temporarily unmounts the source block during slash insertion or selection refresh; the handle chrome can hide, but the command panel stays open until an explicit outside dismissal.
- [x] Make slash and `+` insertion command details follow pointer hover and focus, so advanced affordances like the table-size picker respond to the command under the cursor instead of requiring keyboard navigation first.
- [x] Make block action menu hover and focus update the same selected command state as keyboard navigation, so mouse and keyboard interactions share one active-descendant model.
- [x] Keep slash/`+` and block action panels from rebuilding their full DOM on hover or keyboard selection changes, so small pointer movement no longer creates WebView focus flicker or disappearing command panels.
- [x] Add a table-size picker to the slash/`+` insertion menu so users can insert 1x1 through 6x6 tables instead of only the fixed 3x2 default.
- [x] Refine the slash/`+` insertion panel layout with wider command rows, calmer icon wells, bordered detail panels, focus-visible table cells, and a single-column callout picker so the menu reads like a designed document command surface.
- [x] Add the first Tiptap table floating toolbar with row/column insertion and deletion, cell merge/split, header toggles, and table deletion.
- [x] Upgrade the Tiptap table toolbar into grouped column, row, cell, header, navigation, repair, and delete commands so table editing feels closer to mature document editors.
- [x] Add table-edge quick add controls for inserting a row below and a column to the right without opening the full toolbar.
- [x] Make table-edge quick add controls visually directional: the row inserter is horizontal, the column inserter is vertical, and both use CSS-drawn icons instead of font glyphs so hit targets stay stable.
- [x] Anchor table-edge quick add controls to the actual last row and last column grid edges, so row/column insertion affordances stay aligned when table padding, captions, or uneven content change the outer table rectangle.
- [x] Add hover/focus edge rails to table quick-add controls so row and column insertion reads as a table-edge operation instead of an isolated floating button.
- [x] Add row and column edge handles for tables: clicking the left row rail or top column rail selects the full row/column and reuses the table toolbar for follow-up operations.
- [x] Add a top-left whole-table handle so one click selects the full table before delete, header, alignment, and cell-style operations.
- [x] Replace the always-visible table command strip with a lighter Notion-like table surface: edge `+` controls stay visible for quick row/column insertion, while cell merge, alignment, and color actions live behind a current-cell context trigger.
- [x] Add clear table selection feedback: ProseMirror `selectedCell` and Papyro row/column/table selections render a visible overlay, active edge handles show selected state, and the current-cell trigger is centered with localized labels.
- [x] Scope table context menus by selection semantics: cells show merge/split/alignment/color, rows show row insertion/deletion/header/style actions, columns show column insertion/deletion/header/style actions, and whole-table selection shows only table-level header/repair/delete actions.
- [x] Make table row, column, and whole-table handles click-to-open: selecting an axis now opens the scoped context menu beside the selected range, keeps a stable selection backdrop, and groups commands into a quieter menu so table editing feels closer to the official Tiptap Notion-like reference instead of a dense developer toolbar.
- [x] Make the table cell action trigger select and highlight the focused cell before opening its menu, while preserving existing multi-cell selections, so users can always see which cells the menu will affect.
- [x] Refine the table cell action trigger into a quieter semantic control with selection-kind state and `aria-expanded`, so single-cell, multi-cell, row, column, and table menus are visually and accessibly distinct.
- [x] Keep table context menu grouping on stable command group keys while localizing visible labels, so alignment and cell-color icon/swatch layouts remain stable across English and Chinese.
- [x] Order table context menus by user intent: common insert/header actions appear first, destructive row/column/table deletion is visually quieter and placed last.
- [x] Use full action labels in table context menus while keeping the keyboard toolbar compact, so row/column/cell menus read like user actions instead of terse developer controls.
- [x] Promote table context menus into localized command panels with a Table eyebrow, selection-specific titles, concise selection summaries, and wider Notion-like spacing so users know exactly whether they are editing a cell, range, row, column, or whole table.
- [x] Add table cell alignment commands: left, center, and right use Tiptap `setCellAttribute('align', ...)` so pipe table alignment remains part of the Markdown document model.
- [x] Refine table context menus into explicit command rows with stable icon wells, CSS-drawn row/column/header/merge/delete glyphs, stable scrollbar gutters, and a restrained active rail so table operations feel intentional instead of button-strip-like.
- [x] Make table cell context menus feel more document-native: single-cell menus include split-cell recovery, multi-cell menus stay focused on merge and styling, and menus anchor to the small cell trigger instead of jumping to a broad cell edge.
- [x] Make table toolbar command buttons pointer-first so WebView focus ordering does not swallow table operations.
- [x] Keep table context menus stable across editor blur and WebView focus races, so clicking row/column/cell actions or moving focus through table chrome no longer dismisses the menu before users can choose a command.
- [x] Normalize table toolbar active alignment states so default/left/center/right cells reflect the actual Markdown table state.
- [x] Make table context menu hover and focus sync the active command state, matching keyboard navigation and keeping table command panels predictable for mixed mouse/keyboard use.
- [x] Expose the table repair action in whole-table context menus so users can recover malformed table structure from the same scoped menu as header and delete actions.
- [x] Add shared Tiptap UI primitives for popover placement, menu active-descendant state, toolbar roots, and visibility handling.
- [x] Respect Tiptap `editor.can()` in the table toolbar so unavailable row, column, cell, and repair actions render disabled instead of looking clickable.
- [x] Add keyboard access to the Tiptap table toolbar: Shift+F10 opens it from a table selection, arrow keys move between enabled commands, Enter/Space runs the focused command, and Escape closes it.
- [x] Add shared floating dismiss lifecycle to the slash/`+` insertion menu, block action menu, floating format toolbar, and table toolbar so outside clicks, scrolling, and window changes close overlays while the current block/table bridge stays interactive.
- [x] Keep slash and block action menu keyboard navigation scrolled to the active item so long Notion-like menus remain usable from the keyboard.
- [x] Group the slash/`+` insertion menu into quiet Text/List/Block/Advanced sections and remove repeated right-side group tags, making insertion feel closer to mature document editors.
- [x] Give the block action menu explicit group layout metadata and a separated danger section so localized labels, swatch-style groups, and destructive actions do not depend on fragile CSS structure detection.
- [x] Add advanced block action menus and responsive editor toolbar behavior.
- [x] Fix Tiptap Hybrid scroll-container constraints so long documents scroll inside the editor host instead of being clipped by the outer shell.
- [x] Preserve Tiptap `content_changed`, `insert_markdown`, and `set_view_mode` protocol behavior with runtime tests.
- [x] Skip stale Source/Hybrid selection snapshots after Markdown content changes so mode switching cannot restore an old cursor into updated text.
- [x] Preserve Tiptap `save_requested`, `paste_image_requested`, and `runtime_error` protocol behavior; keep `runtime_ready` host-owned.
- [x] Preserve Tiptap undo/redo through a dedicated history command controller and stable Rust message routing, without leaking history actions into selection-only format UI.
- [x] Preserve Tiptap `set_preferences` state updates through a tested controller.
- [x] Carry the app language through `set_preferences` so Tiptap slash menus, block actions, table toolbar labels, and handle affordances follow Chinese/English UI settings.
- [x] Preserve Tiptap `auto_link_paste` behavior for selected-text URL paste.
- [x] Guard slash and block action menu keyboard handling during IME composition so Chinese input confirmation is not mistaken for menu navigation or command execution.
- [x] Preserve `set_block_hints` as a Tiptap migration compatibility message.
- [x] Preserve Tiptap `destroy` semantics with stale instance protection.
- [x] Add Tiptap task list extensions with checked/unchecked Markdown round-trip coverage.
- [x] Add Tiptap table extensions with pipe table round-trip coverage and rich insert command support.
- [x] Add Tiptap math extensions with inline/display Markdown round-trip coverage and KaTeX preview/error states.
- [x] Add Tiptap Mermaid extensions with fenced code round-trip coverage and shared preview/error rendering.
- [x] Add Tiptap image extensions with local URL Markdown round-trip coverage and shared paste/drop protocol support.
- [x] Add Tiptap code block options with language metadata, fenced Markdown round-trip coverage, and shared code styling.
- [x] Add Tiptap callout/admonition blocks with `> [!NOTE]`-style Markdown round-trip coverage, slash/`+` insertion, block action insertion, and token-based styling.
- [x] Add a release-smoke Markdown fixture to automated round-trip coverage so headings, Chinese text, lists, tasks, callouts, code, aligned tables, math, Mermaid, and images stay guarded before manual QA.
- [x] Add a dedicated Tiptap release-smoke fixture checker and wire it into the full local check scripts.
- [x] Migrate task lists, tables, math, Mermaid, images, and code blocks.
- [x] Remove CodeMirror npm dependencies and obsolete JS runtime tests.
- [x] Remove remaining `.cm-*` CSS and rename the host surface to semantic Tiptap/editor classes.
- [x] Finish full automated acceptance checks and push the completed migration.
- [x] Implement full block drag-and-drop reordering through the Papyro block action handle with a tested ProseMirror transaction mover and drop indicator.
- [x] Define the release-candidate [Tiptap Release Smoke Checklist](tiptap-release-smoke.md).
- [ ] Execute release-candidate manual smoke for Source/Hybrid/Preview, Chinese IME, paste, undo, tables, math, Mermaid, images, outline, failed saves, and OS-opened Markdown files.

## Phase 4.5 - Themes, Typography, And Markdown Styles

Goal: give users several high-quality visual choices without making the app feel like a random theme gallery.

- [x] Define a theme system with semantic tokens for app chrome, editor canvas, Markdown content, code blocks, selections, focus rings, and status colors.
- [x] Ship a small curated set of polished themes first: System, Light, Dark, GitHub-like light/dark, high-contrast, and one warm reading theme.
- [x] Research open-source Markdown style references before adopting any visual baseline. Candidate references include [`sindresorhus/github-markdown-css`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) for GitHub-flavored Markdown layout and color behavior, plus well-known code theme ecosystems such as [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js), and [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).
- [x] Keep Markdown render styles compatible across Preview and Hybrid so headings, lists, tables, blockquotes, code, math, and Mermaid do not visually drift between modes.
- [x] Replace odd font presets with practical system-first presets: UI Sans, System Serif, Reading Serif, Mono Code, and CJK-friendly fallback stacks.
- [x] Make font settings understandable for normal users: preview text, clear labels, safe defaults, and no obscure font names as the first choices.
- [x] Add theme and Markdown-style snapshot/smoke checks so future CSS changes do not break contrast, spacing, or code readability.

## Phase 5 - File Association, Tabs, And Workspace Sessions

Goal: make external Markdown files feel native.

Required behavior:

- [x] When the OS opens a Markdown file with Papyro, the current window receives the file-open event.
- [x] Tabs update to include the opened Markdown file.
- [x] The sidebar workspace switches to the opened file's parent workspace when needed.
- [x] If several tabs belong to different workspace roots, switching tabs updates the sidebar tree to that tab's workspace.
- [x] Dirty tabs are flushed or protected before switching workspace context.
- [x] Watcher subscriptions follow the active workspace safely.
- [x] Recent workspace/file metadata records this flow.

Recommended architecture:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    os["OS file association"]
    shell["desktop shell"]
    request["MarkdownOpenRequest"]
    router["ProcessRuntimeSession route"]
    flow["open_markdown_target flow"]
    workspace["workspace bootstrap/reload"]
    tabs["EditorTabs"]
    tree["FileState tree"]
    watcher["workspace watcher"]

    os --> shell --> request --> router --> flow
    flow --> workspace
    flow --> tabs
    flow --> tree
    flow --> watcher
```

Professional constraints:

- Opening a file outside the current workspace must not silently discard dirty tabs.
- The active tab should be the source of truth for which workspace tree is shown.
- A future multi-window mode must route files through a real `WindowSession`, not a one-off desktop shortcut.
- Tests should cover same-workspace open, external-parent bootstrap, dirty-tab protection, watcher switching, and tab activation.

## Phase 6 - Multi-Window Mode

Goal: support advanced workflows after single-window routing is reliable.

- [x] Define production `ProcessRuntime` and `WindowSession` ownership.
- [x] Move settings to a process-level tool window first.
- [x] Remove desktop settings-window white flash, carry full i18n into newly opened windows, and use the Papyro app icon instead of the default Dioxus icon.
- [x] Add document window routing behind `NoteOpenMode::MultiWindow`.
- [x] Ensure each window owns its own tab contents, selection, and dirty state.
- [x] Share storage and settings safely across windows.
- [x] Add save-conflict tests across windows.

Multi-window should not be rushed. It is a reliability feature, not just a UI feature.

## Phase 7 - Packaging And Release Readiness

Goal: make Papyro installable and understandable for non-developers.

- [x] Define license.
- [x] Add release packaging for desktop.
- [x] Add app icons for target platforms.
- [x] Add first-run workspace onboarding.
- [x] Add manual QA checklist for release builds.
- [x] Document known limitations.
- [ ] Add About-window actions for checking updates and viewing release notes before publishing.

## Ongoing Product Principles

- Avoid adding permanent chrome unless it improves writing or navigation.
- Prefer icons for familiar actions and text for destructive or ambiguous actions.
- Keep the editor area visually calm.
- Do not hide data safety behind convenience.
- Treat performance budgets as feature requirements.
- Keep architecture docs current enough that a new contributor can make the next correct change.
